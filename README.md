# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Meet App
A serverless React PWA (progressive web application) app, written using a TDD (test driven development) approach.  It uses the Google API Calendar to display upcoming events, and gives the user the ability to search by city and also display a specified number of results (events).  The app also displays visual aids to show upcoming events in their city of choosing and to show popularity of event genres.  OAuth is used for authorization flow.

## Project Features & Scenarios
